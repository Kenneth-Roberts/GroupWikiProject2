The geometry of Euclid is built upon assumptions regarding the coexistence of elements. The instruments allowed to be used in Euclidean constructions are compass and straightedge. Of course, straight lines cannot be drawn with the compasses, but any straight line arrived at in Euclidean construction can be determined by the compasses alone by finding two points of the line. Euclid proposed five common notions, five “axioms,” or common notions, and five geometric “postulates” :

Axioms

> 1. Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
> 2. If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.
> 3. If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
> 4. Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another.
> 5. The whole is greater than the part.

Postulates
> 1. It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any other point.
> 2. It is possible to produce a finite straight line indefinitely in that straight line.
> 3. It is possible to describe a circle with any point as the center and with a radius equal to any finite straight line drawn from the center.
> 4. All right angles are equal to one another.
> 5. If a straight line intersects two straight lines so as to make the interior angles on one side of it together less than two right angles, these straight lines will intersect, if indefinitely produced, on the side on which are the angles which are together less than two right angles.
